# Gravity: Analog pH Sensor/Meter Kit V2

DFRobot Gravity: Analog pH meter V2 is specifically designed to measure the pH of the solution and reflect the acidity or alkalinity. DFRobot ph sensor is commonly used in various applications such as aquaponics, aquaculture, and environmental water testing.

As an upgraded version of pH meter V1, this product greatly improves the precision and user experience. The onboard voltage regulator chip supports the wide voltage supply of 3.3~5.5V, which is compatible with the 5V and 3.3V main control boards. The output signal filtered by hardware has low jitter. The software library adopts the two-point calibration method, and can automatically identify two standard buffer solutions (4.0 and 7.0), so simple and convenient.

The sensor can be easily connected to most popular microcontrollers  (such as Arduino), with its Arduino library, you can quickly build a pH meter, plug and play. DFRobot provides a variety of water quality ph analog sensor products, uniform size, and interface, not only meeting the needs of various water quality measuring  but are also suitable for the DIY multi-parameter water quality tester.

The pH is a value that measures the acidity or alkalinity of the solution. It is also called the hydrogen ion concentration index. The pH is a scale of hydrogen ion activity in the solution. The pH has a wide range of uses in medicine, chemistry, and agriculture. Usually, the pH is a number between 0 to 14. Under the thermodynamic standard conditions, pH=7, which means the solution is neutral; pH<7, which means the solution is acidic; pH>7, which means the solution is alkaline.
